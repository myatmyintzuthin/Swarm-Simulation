# Swarm-Simulation
A MATLAB simulation of the school of fish scavenging around the different food sources using physics calculations and gradient descent.
Fishes are attracted by the food sources defined on the landmark and they will be wandering around the food sources without colliding each other. 

                  Food Sources	            Concentration
                    Yellow	                     20
                    Green	                       12
                    Blue	                       9
                    Black	                       2
